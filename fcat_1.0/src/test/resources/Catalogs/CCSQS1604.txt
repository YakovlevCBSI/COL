As the default camera mode, Auto scene recognition turns HDR on and off depending on your scene. HDR mode takes multiple shots with varied exposures and then merges them together to make your photos look natural - even in backlit conditions.Clear photos and video even when backlit, thanks to HDR for photos HDR for photos and video - natural colors in any light  HDR (High Dynamic Range) is an imaging technology that gives you clear photos against strong backlight. With HDR, your Android smartphone captures the same image at different exposure levels and layers them to create one optimized photo.

Just think what it can do for you now!"	"Built-In Flash Memory Chip Sony AIT (Advanced Intelligent Tape) format is intelligently engineered to stand apart—no other tape cartridge features both an MIC chip (the brains) and a pure metal magnetic layer designed for maximum capacity and longevity (the brawn). Now Sony delivers 100% pure cobalt for high retentivity. Patented process for depositing a pure metal magnetic layer directly on the basefilm without adhesive or binders. The benefit from this AME technology is maximum recording performance. The AIT cartridges feature a built-in flash memory chip that stores directory and operational information. The result is rapid access to desired data and greatly reduced loading and ejection times. The tape surface is protected by a smooth carbon coating that is nearly as hard as diamond and 20 times harder than metal oxides. The benefit is maximum reliability and life. AIT-2 technology helps launch the space shuttle and preserves priceless interviews and eyewitness accounts of holocaust survivors. Now AIT-3 takes another leap forward— doubling capacity, performance and durability in the same small format. Just think what it can do for you now!
